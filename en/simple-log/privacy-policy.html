                <h4 class="mx-5">What data do we collect?</h4>
                <p class="mt-3 mb-4 mx-5">
                    When using the application normally, no data is collected or sent to the developer. All data the user enters into the fields of the application is 
                    stored locally. The user has the possibility to backup his logbook database to Google Drive, a cloud storage service run by Google, 
                    or Apple iCloud, a cloud storage service run by Apple. If the user wants to use the feature via Google Drive, he is required to log in with a Google account by 
                    the means of an OAuth2 login procedure. To avoid further logins, the user's email address is then stored locally in an encrypted manner. 
                    <br>Furthermore, when reporting errors of the application, the user can choose to create a log file and send it to the developer. 
                    The log file consists of information about the operating system, a timestamp, the actions triggered within the software before any error occured 
                    and (if any) errormessages. Primary means of communication for resolving errors in the application is via email. 
                    All information sent to us via email is then stored accessible only by the developer until the inquiry was handled or the problem has been resolved.
